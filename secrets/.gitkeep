# This file ensures the secrets/ directory is tracked by Git.
# Do NOT add real secrets to Git!
#
# Create these files locally (and add secrets inside):
# - api_key
# - db_password
# - id_rsa          (SSH private key â€” never commit)
# - id_rsa.pub      (public key for user setup)
#
# secrets/ should be added to .gitignore
